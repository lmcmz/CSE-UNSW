    "# COMP6714 Word Embeddings Demonstration using Tensorflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate a basic implementation of Word Embbeddings by training the **skip-gram** model using a small test corpus: **Text8** (based on Tensorflow's word2vec tutorial). It will provide you with hands on experience prior to COMP6714 Project2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key part of word embeddings is the training data. In this implementation, mini-batches are generated on demand, and are used by the model to update the word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to play with this implementation, change model parameters and the training data, and analyze effect of these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you do not need to dig too deep into the tensorflow and the training part, though if you are into deep learning, it is good to do so.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the quality of the embeddings by computing top-10 most nearest words for a sample of words. You will observe that semantically coherent words are embedded close to each other in the embedding space.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some instructions for this notebook are given as under:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We are using **`Tensorflow 1.2.1`**, for this implementation, but this code will work for any version greater than **`1.0`**.\n",
    "2. For Tensorflow installation, please follow the link: **https://www.tensorflow.org/install/**\n",
    "3. This notebook will automatically download the training dataset: **'text8.zip'** for Word Embeddings.\n",

    "This function is used to generate training batch for the **skip-gram model**. We are using minibatch stochastic-gradient descent to optimize the objective function. For this, we generate a training batch based on following input parameters: **batch_size**, **num_samples**, and **skip_window**.\n",

Note that all `CENTER_WORD`s are stored and returned in the list `batch`, and all `CONTEXT_WORD`s are stored and returned in the list `label`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the `skip-gram` model, we generate training data by capturing the context words from the surrondings of a target word. Here the parameter: **skip_window** defines a sliding window size of size (2*`skip_window`+1), i.e., up to `skip_window` words to the left and right of the center word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Within a sliding window, we need to sample **num_samples** of context words (i.e., excluding the center word). `num_samples` should be no larger than 2*`skip_window`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**<br>\n",
    "As an example, with **batch_size**= 8, **skip_window** = 1, and **num_samples** = 2, it generates following data batch. We consider these words as `(input,output)` pairs for the `skip-gram` model.\n",

    "    * We only need to consider (8/2) center words. \n",
    "    * We start from the second word (so that it has a full-sized sliding window). \n",
    "2. With **skip_window** = 1, **num_samples** = 2, we  generate two samples from two context words (in random order).\n",
    "3. The implementation here is a slightly modified version from tensorflow's word2vec tutorial code; it is still a very ugly implementation. "
